 Dockermon Inspiration
</h2>

Dockermon was created as a tool for myself to learn some new technologies. It was a cold boring winter as I joined The Great Resignation in a total burnout. I took some time off and did not touch a computer for over a month. I became so bored that I had to do something and being out of work, the budget wasn't there to play around in AWS, so I turned to Docker as my outlet. 

My goal was to learn NestJS with TypOrm, React / Next, Redux and as many development platforms to expand my professional experience of Node, Express, Angular, Mongo / MySQL.  I needed something to leverage these new tools and work with, so I chose the Docker [Docker Engine API v1.41](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.41){:target="_blank"} and wow, did it become a project! 

Now that I spent a month building Dockermon, I have decided to share it with others and hope you'll find it useful. Meanwhile, I'm off to find a job with the new skills I learned building this. Wish me luck!
